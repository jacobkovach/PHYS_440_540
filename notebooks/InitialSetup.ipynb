If you need help with branches, see [Chapter 4 of DataCamp's Introduction to Git lesson](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-git).  \n",
    "2. If you happened to execute/save any class notebooks ahead of the schedule, you can run the following command can get back to the last commit before syncing your repository with the class repository.

If you don't know *any* Python at all, this class may be pretty tough going.  However, many of you might need a refresher.  A good place to start is **Appendix A** (more specifically A3) in the [textbook](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691198309/statistics-data-mining-and-machine-learning-in-astronomy).  \n",

If you need a Python refresher, I suggest that you work through their [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) and [Intermediate Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science); indeed you'll do one of these for Homework 1.\n",

    "To start with Python uses the following [numerical data types and operations](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will encounter three main types of collections of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lists: a mutable array of data\n",
    "    Tuples: ordered, immutable list\n",
    "    Dictionaries: keyword/value lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that python begins indexing at 0 and uses [row-major order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-major_order), which means that pairs of values are written as (y,x) instead of (x,y).  This actually makes sense when one is dealing with tables of data.\n",
    "\n",

    "Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "    its most notable property is that it is immutable – after being defined, it cannot be changed\n",
    "    denoted by parentheses, e.g., x=(5.0,7.0,9.0,11.0)\n",
    "    to index, use square brackets, e.g., print(x[0])\n",
    "    can get part of one using :, e.g., try print(x[2:]) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "List\n",
    "\n",
    "    in contrast to a tuple, it can be reassigned\n",
    "    denoted with brackets, e.g,. y=[5.0,7.0,9.0,11.0]\n",
    "    to index, also use square brackets, e.g., print(x[0])\n",

E.g., if you have an object called `shape` and shape contains information like `area`, `length`, `width`, etc., then you access those values as\n",
